        <h1>Career after B.Tech/B.E.</h1>
        <img src="img/engineer1.webp" width="40%"><br>
B.Tech./B.E. is a technical course that comes with many specializations. Based on your interest, you can choose a B.Tech /B.E specialization. After completing this degree, you can look for jobs or continue higher studies as per your requirement.
<div class="=Overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
After completing the B.Tech course, candidates can either pursue higher studies (one popular exam that they can give for this is GATE) or consider pursuing a job after B.Tech in the field of their choice. Although M.Tech is a natural course choice after completing a B.Tech course, these days many students opt to take up an MBA course after completing their B. Tech degree program.

Other options that aspirants can consider include picking up a job at a PSU (Public Sector Undertaking), taking the Civil Services entrance exam, or joining a private company. Let’s talk about each of these in detail.
</div>
<br><br>
<section>
<div>
<h1>1. B.Tech College Placements
</h1>College placements are one of the most popular career options after engineering. They have become an integral part of the offerings of good engineering institutes.
<br><br>
Campus placements take you directly to recruiters without much effort and offer you a chance to get a lucrative job. Don’t forget that it will be easier for you to get a job through campus placements than outside because of less competition.
<br><br>

Candidates who want to take part in B.Tech campus placement need to keep the following points in mind:
<ul><li>Keep your resume ready and up-to-date
</li>
<li>Maintain a good score in their subject and be well-aware of what all you did in your internship and your B.Tech project 
</li>
<li>Participate in extracurricular activities 
</li>
<li>Prepare for group discussions
</li>
<li>Do proper research and study about the companies you are applying for
</li>
</ul><br><br>
<h2>2. Higher Studies-Courses after B.Tech
</h2>Pursuing higher studies is one of the most popular career options after engineering. After completing the B.Tech course, the natural flow is that aspirants take admission to an M.Tech program. You can prepare for the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) exam that will test your comprehensive understanding of undergraduate engineering subjects and help you enter the IITs and NITs for M.Tech.
<br><br>
Another option is to prepare for the JAM exam to take admission to some of India’s top colleges for Master’s in Science courses. Besides these degree courses, candidates can pursue short-term and diploma courses after completing their B.Tech course. There are many benefits of certifications, such as helps in: 
<ul><li>Expanding knowledge and skills 
</li><li>Increasing earning potential
</li><li>Giving a competitive advantage
</li><li>Boosting professional credibility
</li><li>Enhancing the pay scale
</li></ul>
<br><br>
<table border="1"><th colspan="2"><b>Popular Certification and Professional Courses after B.Tech</b></th><tr><td>Information Security & Ethical Hacking</td><td>Red Hat Certified Engineer

<tr><td>ISO Lead Auditor Courses	</td><td>Building Design Certification</td></tr>
</table><br><br>
<h2>3. Gaining Industry Experience
</h2>
You can join an internship while pursuing B.Tech. This will help you in gaining the required work experience before you start looking for jobs after B.Tech. Through internships, you can learn the practical applications of the knowledge that you have acquired through the course. Based on this experience, you can assess if you either need to pursue higher studies or you are more comfortable with getting a job. Internships also helps you identify your capabilities as a professional and the areas where you need improvement.
<h2>4. A Job at a PSU (Public Sector Undertaking)
</h2>PSUs include the companies that are partially owned by the state or central or both government sectors. Some of the popular PSU companies include BHEL, LIC, Hindustan Copper Limited, and NALCO.

After completing B.Tech, you can enter PSUs and get a lucrative job. You can get a job either on a permanent or contractual, or temporary basis. PSUs recruit employees based on two categories: 
<br><br>
<ul><li>with a valid GATE score
</li><li>without a GATE score
</li></ul>The PSUs that appoint employees based on the GATE score announce the required GATE score for application every year. 
<br><br><h2>5. Study Management
</h2>Studying management is a popular career choice among engineering graduates. B.Tech and MBA is a great combination that recruiters look for, which is why many students take up an MBA course after B.Tech.
<br><br>
An MBA degree in your resume can help you get management roles in renowned organizations like Accenture and TCS. To enter the management field, you can give the CAT exam (Common Aptitude Test) and get a good score to enter into the management college of your choice. 
<br><br><h2>6. Take the Civil Services Entrance Exam
</h2>If you aspire to serve the nation, then taking the Civil Services Exam is the best option that you can take up after engineering. For this, you will have to clear the UPSC civil services exam. It is considered one of the toughest examinations. Thus, it is recommended that you start preparing for at least a year before applying. 
<br><br>The UPSC offers three optional engineering subjects-civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering. On getting a high rank in the examination, you can get the prestigious positions of IAS, IPS, or IFS. The UPSC Engineering Services selection process is divided into three stages:
<br><br><ul><li>Stage-I: Engineering Services (Preliminary/Stage-I) Examination (Objective Type Papers)
</li><li>Stage-II: Engineering Services (Main/Stage-II) Examination (Conventional Type Papers)
</li><li>Stage-III: Personality Test 
</li></ul>
<br><br><h2>7. Serve the Nation-Join the Defense
</h2>If you are patriotic and are eager to serve the country, then you can join the Indian Army or Navy, or Air Force after B.Tech. Indian army has a highly skilled technical wing that supports the troops on the field. Thus, there are many opportunities for engineers in the technical wings of the Indian army. 
<br>A career in defense is considered one of the most prestigious and respected careers. It will offer you good pay, job security, as well as fulfill your passion to serve the nation. You can take up the University Entry Scheme (UES), Air Force Common Admission Test (AFCAT), or Short Service Commission (SSC) Entrance Test after B.Tech to enter this field. 
<br><br><h2>8. Entrepreneurship
</h2>You can also choose the path of entrepreneurship after engineering. Gone are the days when engineering graduates used to stay away from entrepreneurship. Nowadays, the success of many startups inspires many engineers to set up their own businesses. <br>
As an engineer entrepreneur, you will have the freedom to express your creativity and ideas. Since this path might be full of a lot of challenges, it is recommended that you check the positive and negative sides of it very carefully before you choose this option.
<br><br>
<h2>9. A Job in the Private Sector
</h2>The career opportunities after B.Tech are more in technical fields. Apart from the public sector, any engineering graduate can secure a good job in the private sector as well. Besides getting hired as engineers, B.Tech graduates are also recruited as researchers, consultants, subject matter experts, and more. 
<br>While campus placements are a great way to get leads for the private sector, you can also start some research of your own. You can register yourself in reputed job portals like Naukri.com for jobs relevant to your expertise area.
